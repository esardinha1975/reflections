When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you wanna distribute and share your work along other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe we might want to stay at a specific commit or branch, etc.
