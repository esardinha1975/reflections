When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you wanna distribute and share your work along other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe we might want to stay at a specific commit or branch, etc.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

We clone one repository to get all history of development and also when we wanna contribute 
to projects (and we are able and have permission to). We fork one repository when we wanna 
evolve an existent work but we don't have permission to do so. Branches are alternative 
paths to create, test and experiment with new features, changes, refactorings, etc, etc.
