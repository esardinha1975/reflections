What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden folder called ".git" which contains all metadata 
necessary to manage the repository and files you are going to commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate area where your changes live before you commit them.
It is an interesting feature of Git as you can check all your changes (and 
change again or revert them) before committing.
